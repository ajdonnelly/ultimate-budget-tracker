# ultimate-budget-tracker


The Ultimate Budget Tracker gives users a fast and easy way to track their money and, with offline functionality, allows them to access that information at any time. Easily add expenses and deposits to your budget with or without a connection. 

Need to use IndexedDB to add offline functionality. Review Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 4: Add Offline Persistence with IndexedDB as a refresher on how to add this to your application. Done. 

You’ll also need to add a service worker to your application. Review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 4: Using Service Workers as a refresher on how to add this to your application.

REWIND
The Food Festival application that you created in this module's lessons did not include an Express.js server, so you used the webpack-dev-server npm module to test the service worker with an HTTPS-enabled server.

For this Challenge, however, you aren't using webpack, but you do have an Express.js server provided to you in the starter code. Remember that Chrome DevTools makes it possible to test service workers on localhost in development. Simply click the Application tab, then select Service Workers from the menu on the left.

You can also review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 5: Convert the App to a PWA as a refresher on web manifests.

Deployment to Heroku Using MongoDB Atlas
Finally, the budget tracker has a server and uses MongoDB as its database, so you’ll need to deploy this application to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas. To review this process, look at Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 5: Add Mongoose Validation, specifically 18.5.5: Deploy to Heroku.
